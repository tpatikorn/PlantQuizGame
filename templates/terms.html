    <h2>6. About That</h2>
    <p>
        Well, if you read to this point and I would like to say I'm quite impressed by your prudence. The above
        statement (second part of Termination of Services) is, of course, a joke. It's not binding and was intentionally
        added as a lesson for caution. In fact, the entire ToU is generated by ChatGPT (except a few bits added by me).
        Here's the short version of actual data policy: if you sign in, I will see only the information Google gave me
        i.e. you email address,
        first name, last name, display name, and a URL to your profile photo from your Gmail account. In additions, most
        activities in this site is logged including but not limited to when you click a button or link. Your data won't
        be sold anywhere (and I don't even know where to lol) and won't be transferred to 3rd party without prior
        notice to the data owner, specified by the email address logged, except as a part of research to further
        humanity's knowledge, in which case the data will be anonymized before being transferred. Data logged are
        subject to deletion without prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
        Should you harbor inquiries or seek elucidation on any aspect of these terms, we extend an invitation to
        communicate with us. We pledge to address your concerns promptly and with due diligence, but do not promise any
        responses.
